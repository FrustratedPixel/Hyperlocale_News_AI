ADYAR TIMES / MAY 18 - 24, SUMMER CAMP Every morning from 7.45 am to 8.15 am, Elliot’s beach comes to life with melodious music. At the far end of the promenade, near the walkway into the beach, a cheerful group of friends gather after their brisk walk to sing songs, creating a unique blend of music, movement, and camaraderie. As one approaches, familiar tunes of M.G. Ramachandran and Sivaji Ganesan echo through the air. Walkers break into spontaneous dance and tap their feet to classics like ‘Madras Nalla Madras’ and ‘Pon Ondru Kanden’. “This is our dose of joy. Dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin and endorphin - we get them all naturally. It feels like we are Dr.Rajendran, a fellow walker. It all started when K.R.Chandrasekaran (a frequent contributor for Adyar Times), spotted P.Gnanadoss, a fellow walker and freelance singer, humming in a corner of the beach with his friends. Recognising a shared passion for music, he suggested that their group gather at the quieter corner of the beach and listen to Gnanadoss sing timeless classics. What began as an informal sing-along soon grew into a full-fledged morning ritual, with the group steadily expanding. “All singing extempore - no rehearsal, no barriers between old and new songs, no genre limits,” points out K.R.Chandrasekaran and adds, “Because of this session, many casual walkers have become regular walkers. Some even travel from as far as Nungambakkam and Sunrise symphony by the sea A major fire erupted at the Perungudi garbage dump yard on the night of May 14, sending thick plumes of toxic smoke across several parts of the city. The blaze is believed to have been caused by buried plastic waste reacting to the intense summer heat, sparking concern among environmental experts and local residents. Areas including Velachery, Taramani, Madipakkam, and Pallikaranai have been severely affected by the smoke. Residents have reported breathing difficulties, eye irritation, and other respiratory issues due to the poor air quality. The Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services were quick to respond and are continuing efforts to bring the blaze under control. Water tankers and firefighting equipment have been deployed at the site. The Perungudi dump yard covers an area of 228 acres and takes in unsegregated waste generated from Zones 9 to 14 of the city. Some segregation of waste is happening on site; however, with legacy waste accumulated at the venue, damage to the environment is A leaf from the past A similar fire had broken out in May , which was fueled by the various combustible gases generated in the dump yard. P.Natarajan, Founder Member of Namma Ooru Foundation, had explained, “Unsegregated legacy waste has accumulated at the venue for the past nearly 25 years. Now with bio-mining, companies are digging to see if anything can be salvaged. The process of bio-mining can also produce Methane gas. This legacy waste also contains food items packed in covers, thus enabling anaerobic composting, which releases the greenhouse gas, Methane. Apart from Methane, other gases are also produced from electronic, medical waste, plastic, glass, and clothes waste. Such gases are not only potential fire feeders, but also harmful for the workers at the venue, if and when they inhale them.” In May , post the fire, the effects of the Methane gas could also be witnessed with the growth of the Deja vu at Perungudi dump with fire reported again! Methylobacteria in the adjacent lake, turning the lake pink. The presence of the bacteria is harmful to the aquatic ecosystem of the already polluted The way forward Chennaiites hope that the situation is controlled at the earliest, legacy waste is cleared and there is no more dumping. Environmentalists point out that strict implementation of source segregation is the way forward, where the green (wet) waste can be composted, blue bin waste can be recycled and the red bin waste can be sent to the Corporation for appropriate disposal. Over the years, the city has also seen an increase in waste collection drives, which are a good outlet for residents to dispose of their unwanted items for recycling. Unless stringent measures are adopted to address the legacy waste and enforce source segregation, Perungudi risks becoming a recurring nightmare for both the environment and its residents. OMR to join in. If there is any beach cleaning activity, we will get some young participants as well.” The group members suggest songs through a WhatsApp group ‘Kadarkarai Kaalai Raagam’, and based on that, the songs for the next day are chosen. “Songs of T.M.S, P.B.S and S.P.B dominate the playlist,” says an excited Sankaranarayanan, a member. Currently, most of the group members are men, with the average age of about 70, but they look forward to more participation by women and youngsters. “This is our therapy, our golden hour — and we want others to enjoy it too,” he “We have so many stories to tell about the joy that is spread around,” says Chandrasekaran as he reminisces about an expectant mother in full term, who joined their group for relaxing, “A few days back, the father of the new mother came bearing sweets and the good news of a safe and sweet delivery.” He also points to an elderly lady who is an MGR fan and has interacted with him on the set of ‘Padagotti’, “She comes here specifically to hear us sing MGR songs.” Looking ahead, the group hopes to expand their sessions by incorporating laughter yoga and light aerobics to make their mornings even more energising. With music in their hearts and the sea breeze on their faces, this beachside band proves that wellness and happiness can be as simple as a song.

We must collectively raise awareness and provide support to those affected.” The event included expert-led sessions on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, as well as first-hand accounts from Thalassaemia patients.

Canine issues at Elliot’s beach  I am writing to bring to your attention the growing concern of dog menace at Besant Nagar beach. While the beach is a beautiful place to start the day, the presence of stray dogs has become a safety issue. These dogs often bark and chase walkers, which can be intimidating, especially for senior citizens and children. Moreover, their waste is not properly cleaned up, posing health risks to beachgoers. I have enclosed pictures of the situation, which will highlight the urgency of the matter. I request the authorities to take necessary steps to address this issue, such as increasing the number of dog catchers or implementing measures to sterilise and vaccinate stray dogs in the area. - S. Rangarajan, RBI Colony, Thiruvanmiyur. Ban banners and poster  Though the courts have banned erecting posters and cutouts on city roads, one can seldom see a road free of them. Ironically, some boards are erected on pedestrian footpaths, which are already occupied by hawkers and even some shop owners displaying their wares. Such posters and cutouts are proving to be a hindrance for senior citizens to walk on the footpaths. Moreover, these boards are often erected so low that they hit the heads of even a four-foot-tall man or woman. Although political parties have received some relief from courts to erect their posters on special occasions, they are supposed to dismantle them within a day or two after the function. However, in reality, the posters remain for weeks after the event. Incidentally, we feel that political parties and their leaders may be spending crores on such publicity stunts, funds which could be utilised for feeding lakhs of poor people living in the State. They could even donate these funds to old age homes, etc., whose blessings would be more beneficial. Wake up, leaders, and spend your money for better use than to inconvenience the public with posters, boards, and cutouts on roads and footpaths. - N. Mahadevan, Vannanthurai. Power cut after small shower  No doubt, the unseasonal rain has given some relief to Chennai residents. At the same time, it was a shock that the power was cut early in the morning at 1 am on May 12, for more than an hour in the Besant Nagar area. T.M. Maistry Street experienced a total blackout in some flats, while in others, one phase of the power supply remained on, providing some relief. We feel there need not be any cuts, especially not in the middle of the night when people are trying to sleep. Then, in the morning at 10 am, power was switched off in Maistry Street for repairs and was restored only after 12 pm. We hope this is not a regular feature in the coming hot summer - S. Venugopal, Vannanthurai. Unsafe work: Call for agencies to work  Stormwater drainage construction on Sastri Nagar 6th Cross Street is ongoing. One picture shows concreting done directly on a cable feeding power to apartments on the opposite side from a TANGEDCO pillar. No wonder this cable developed a fault, causing enormous inconvenience to residents. The restoration action - after a few days and after much hemming & hawing - is seen in another picture, where a new cable has been laid resting on a manhole cover and right in front of an apartment driveway. This is hazardous and also bound to fail Request TANGEDCO to take remedial action to make the supply reliable and safe. - N. V. Chandrasekharan, Sastri Nagar. Parking issues on the street  We are residents of Kamaraj Nagar, 19th East Street and would like to report the parking of old, unused private vehicles on both sides of the road. This unauthorised parking prevents the smooth flow of traffic, and it is a struggle for the residents to even enter the street and reach their own houses. Repeated requests have not yielded any action. This is compounded by the presence of the Sai Baba temple events and marriages in the Ramachandra wedding hall in the same area, making the street inaccessible. We request help from the authorities to keep our street clear of random park- - Name withheld on request.
